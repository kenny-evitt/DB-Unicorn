## Overview of the DB Unicorn Library

DB Unicorn is a .NET (4.5) class library for working with Microsoft SQL Server databases, particularly maintaining database schemas<sup>1</sup> and managing changes to specific instances of a database schema.

DB Unicorn is inspired by the wonderful family of [DB Ghost products](http://www.dbghost.com/), made by Innovartis.

<sup>1</sup> 'Schemas' doesn't refer to MSSQL database schema objects (only), but to the entire 'design' of a database, e.g. it's tables, views, stored procedures, and static (lookup) data.
